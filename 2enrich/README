To deploy this module, be sure that ClioPatria is deployed (see parent directory). Then, run 
$ ./configure.sh
and do
$ ./run.sh
to start the service. This service requires several datasets, see the data/ in the parent directory.

This module has several api's:
* epg : enriches an EPG using a service that provides BBC PIDs (see below).
* enrichProgramme : enriches a single BBC program.
* testset : returns a set of ~12K enriched BBC programs. 
* sliceOfTestset : returns a subset of the testset.

The input of the epg api is the NoTube Data Warehouse (DWH). The DWH essentially provides a set of BBC program identifiers (pids) for a given time. The JSON below is an example of what a DWH service call could produce.
