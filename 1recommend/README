To deploy this module, be sure that ClioPatria is deployed (see parent directory). Then, run 
$ ./configure.sh
and do
$ ./run.sh
to start the service. This service requires several datasets, see the data/ in the parent directory.

This module is the Linked Data recommender service. Given a set of enriched items, as generated by the enriched EPG service (the module in the ../2enrich/ directory), it finds links with a user profile containing weighted interests, as generated by the Beancounter service (http://notube-collector.googlecode.com). Below is an example of a user profile in OpenSocial markup:

{"entry":{"id":"1234","appData":{
	"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alien_3":0.2,
	"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_Scorsese":0.3,
	"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coen_brothers":0.3,
	"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bill_Hicks":0.1,
	"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pan's_Labyrinth":0.1
}}}

This module contains the following services:
* patternRecommender : uses a set of predefined patterns to find paths between user interests and item features.
* patternRecommenderForInterest : same as patternRecommender, but uses a single interest instead of a user profile with multiple user interests.
* skosRecommender: recommends items based on path(s) of skos:broader and skos:narrower links between user interests and item annotations. Requires DBpedia Categories in user profile.
